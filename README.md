This website was designed with both functionality and user experience in mind. Here’s a breakdown of the technologies used and the key features implemented:

1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript:

Built from the ground up using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity, speed, and full control over customizations.
Fully responsive design ensures that users across all devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile—enjoy a seamless experience.
2. News API Integration:

The website fetches live news articles using the NewsAPI, updating content dynamically based on users' search queries or selected categories.
Users can browse through the latest news from around the world, view article summaries, and click to read full articles from trusted sources.
3. Animated Search Bar:

One of the coolest features is the interactive search bar. Upon hovering over or clicking the search button, the search bar smoothly expands from the middle, providing users with a delightful experience. Once users move away, the search bar collapses, keeping the interface clean and clutter-free.
The search button hides when the input field is active and reappears when it’s not in use, adding to the minimalistic design.
4. Dynamic News Cards:

Each news article is displayed in a custom card format, with images, titles, source information, and publication dates clearly visible.
The cards were designed to be visually appealing while maintaining a professional look. They have hover effects that give users a subtle interaction cue, improving the overall user experience.
5. Clean, Modern UI:

The website sports a clean, minimalistic design with sharp typography and a focus on usability. The navigation is intuitive, allowing users to easily switch between categories or search for specific topics of interest.
6. Optimized for Speed:

Since performance is critical, I focused on optimizing loading times. Images load efficiently, and API calls are handled asynchronously to ensure smooth user experience, even when fetching a large number of articles.
